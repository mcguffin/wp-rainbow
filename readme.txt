== Frequently asked questions ==

= I found a bug. Where should I post it? =

Depends. If you can break it down to the JavaScript core it would be best placed in the [Rainbow Repository](https://github.com/ccampbell/rainbow) (which is not mine).

Everything else can either go into the Support forum, or in the [WP-Rainbow Repo](https://github.com/mcguffin/wp-rainbow).

= I'd like to suggest a feature. Where should I post it? =

I personally prefer GitHub. The plugin code is here: [GitHub](https://github.com/mcguffin/wp-rainbow)
(See above as well.)

= I want to use the latest files. How can I do this? =

Use the GitHub Repo rather than the WordPress Plugin. Do as follows:
1. If you haven't done so: [Install git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
2. in the console cd into Your 'wp-content/plugins' directory
3. type 'git clone git@github.com:mcguffin/wp-rainbow.git'
4. If you want to update to the latest files (be careful, might be untested on Your WP-Version) type 'git pull'.

= I found a bug and fixed it. How can I let You know? =

Either post it on the [GitHub-repo](https://github.com/mcguffin/wp-rainbow) or—if you cloned the repository—send me a pull request.
